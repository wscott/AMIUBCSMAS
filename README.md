This is a snapshot of an old program for the game Stars!.  I (@wscott on github) didn't write this program or even use it that much, but I do have most every public release of the program so I put them together in a repository to save the code. The version is actually slightly newer that the most recent I could find on the web in 2020.

Pull requests with cleanups and improvements are welcome.

Documentation is in the doc subdirector and the original README is included.
