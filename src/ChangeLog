  screen display to hold more info)

  function management in starana.cc
- added generic terraform tech to hab_when_max_terraformed.
- recoded completely the planetary function part to introduce easier
  manipulation; modified stars_map::display_planets as well as all the

  structure; some other structs added in. Fixed all references to this
  stuff.

  compilation up.
