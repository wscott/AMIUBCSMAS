HOW PLANETARY DISPLAY *REALLY* WORKS

If you tried to play a bit with the planetary display editor you're
probably very confused. This file explains how you can "grab the
power" and have starana really generate the display you want.

Ok, a planet has a lots of info associated to it. The aim of the
planetary functions is to display this information. There are two main
steps: choosing what information to display and choosing how to
compose the different pieces of information.

When a planetary map is requested, a sequence of operations is
performed to associate some "display data" to every planet. The
display data defines how the planet will be represented on-screen.
The display data is composed of 5+1 parts:
- the circles
- the marker
- the lines
- the data
- the name
(- the flag)

The circles represent circles drawn around the planet, filled to
indicate scanner ranges and empty for gates, for example.

The marker is used to draw crosses, squares, dots.

The data is used for "fat dots" and pie charts.

The lines are lines starting from the planet towards some destination
(mass drivers, routing).

The name is placed below the marker/data.

The flag is in parentheses because it doesn't really act on the
display, but can be used to perform interesting composition of
functions.

A planetary function takes a planet and then generates the display
data.  The actual effect depends very much on the function:
'Population' just creates some data which is used for the "fat dot" in
the population display. 'Set names' just puts the name under every
planet.  'Mineral concentrations' generates data for the pie
chart.

There is also a second "class" of functions: filters. They are used to
filter the display information associated to a planet according to
some condition. See at the end of the file for a complete list of
planetary functions.

Invocation of planetary functions can be dependent on what happened
before.  There are several modes of operation:

skip
stomp
and
or

'Skip' just ignores the function and moves to the next, useful in testing.
'Stomp' executes the function on the planet regardless of anything.
'And' executes the function only if 'something' is already defined in
the display data for that planet.
'Or' is the opposite of and, it calls the function only if 'something'
is undefined.

The 'something' can be chosen to be any combination of
marker/data/name/etc.  It is represented by the push buttons
immediately to the right of the mode, which are labelled using the
first letter of the "something".
A pressed button indicates an activated "something".
Examples:
"and" and only "F" (for flag) pressed means that this function
will be executed on planets which have flag set.
"or" and only "M" (for marker) will execute function only on
planets without marker defined.

Even worse, a function can have parameters (16 internally, but only 10
accessible right now). They control the way the function operates. Their name
is set to what they do when you select the function.

The aim of all this mess is to allow someone to create what he wants
with the planetary report. I suggest that you take the examples which
come with the distribution (load them from default.pfl) and look at
them to see how the "bricks" are put together to obtain the result.


FUNCTIONS vs. FILTERS

There are two main classes of functions: real functions (they ADD
stuff) and filters (they KILL stuff).  Note that both of them are
subject to stomp/and/or and so you can create pretty complex things.
Functions do what they say they do, regardless of anything. In
addition to altering the display information they operate on they also
set the flag to true for any planet where they do something. If they
can't operate on the planet (e.g. lack of info) then flag is left
untouched. Functions stomp any previous data: set marker kills any
marker previously defined. "Population" followed by "habitability"
will result in habitability, with the population data getting
destroyed. No incompatibility exists for two different "types" of
display information: set marker doesn't mess with data, circles, etc.

Filters are different. They can be used in two main ways: kill and
flag.  All filters have a parameter 1 called "fields affect mask"
which is a sequence of 1s and 0s telling the filter what to kill. Just
imagine it like a 6-digit binary number. The sequence is the same as
the one used in the mode "something" display: 111000 tells the filter
to kill CLD (circles, lines, data) for any planet which satisfies
filter conditions.  You can for example generate mineral
concentrations and then kill all the data for planets which you don't
own.

The second mode is activated by giving a field affect mask equal to 0.
This would indicate that the filter should perform nothing at all, but
it's false :) What really happens is that it will set the flag to
"true" for any planet it would filter and to "false" otherwise.
Filter on owner will then flag all the planets owned by the specified
race.  You can then use any function in mode "and-Flag" to execute the
function only on the planets you own. Piling up filters with
"and-F"/"or-F" allows you to actually perform and/or of them.

The second method should be preferred as it's easier to understand and
it does not waste time generating data that will be killed immediately
after.



STEP-BY-STEP DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE: Surface minerals

This predefined view displays all planets, marking the inhabited ones
and setting their name color to that of the owner, but for the
viewpoint instead of the marker you have a pie indicating the amount
of surface minerals.
Let's see (one way) to do it:

First of all, let's set a square marker at all inhabited worlds:


* Filter: owner
* Stomp mode
* Race = -1 (anyone)
* No affect mask (select)

* Set Marker
* And mode (on flag) - to operate only on planets selected by filter
* Marker type 3 (a box)

We now have markers on all inhabited worlds, let's add the name to
those worlds, leaving the uninhabiteds out.

* Set Planet Name
* And mode (on flag)

Ok, now we turn name into owner color with the appropriate function:

* Color: name
* And mode (on flag)
* Color = 0 (i.e. color of owner)

Now let's add the actual surface minerals pie for the viewpoint:

* Filter: owner
* Stomp mode (i.e. ignore anything occurred before)
* Race = 0 (viewpoint)

* Surface Minerals
* And mode (on flag) - to operate only on viewpoint's planets
* Full circle at 0kT (which means use default value)

Ok, we now have a problem: data and marker are non-exclusive, so if we
end here we will have the pie of the surface minerals with a white box
marker on it. Since we don't want the marker we just kill it:

* Filter: unconditional
* And mode (on flag)
* Affect mask: 000100 (i.e. kill the marker)

In order to have a less sparse map we add a point at all the
uninhabited planets:

* Set Marker
* Or mode (on data or marker)
* Marker type = 1 (i.e. the dot)

The "or" makes the function be executed only on planets that DON'T
have nor data nor marker associated to them.  If we had set it to be
"or on name" we would have obtained the same effect.

Easy, isn't it? :)

ADDING PLANETARY FUNCTIONS

Planetary functions are designed to be easy to add (if you know C++).
All the and/or,data/marker stuff is already treated by the
stars_map::display_planets() function. When your function is called it
should verify that it CAN generate the data and then generate it.
Adding functions does NOT require you to modify anything in the rest
of the sources. You just derive a new subclass from planetary_function
and then create an object from the class giving it the name which must
then appear on the map.  Then add your source file in the list of the
PFMODULES in the Makefile and type make. 
Usually, the easiest way is to find a function already defined which
'almost' does what you want, copy and then hack it.
