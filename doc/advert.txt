AMIUBCSMAS 0.2

or

Alberto's Most Incomplete, Undocumented and Badly Coded
Stars! Mapper, Analyzer and Simulator

(called "StarAna", as in STARs! ANAlyzer, by friends)


WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES

- Given a set of map/pla/fle files and some additional data you
  provide (race designs and any other stuff you feel like typing in
  such as planetary stats and queues), it performs a simulation of the
  "future" for N years, taking into account: pop growth, queue
  construction, mineral usage, mineral mining, concentration decay,
  terraforming (approximate), fleets carrying pop/minerals.

- Creates a report-log file with too much information: habitability
  tables, planetary growth/production/mining/terraforming,
  "suggestions" about pop filling threshold crossing and mineral
  shipment, global empire stats (pop growth, resource growth, total
  minerals/mining, etc).

- Generate a set of maps not normally available in stars, the list is
  too long to be written, since it features some kind of "basic
  functions" that you can compose to generate more complex displays.
  You can have the "space ownership display" as in starmap as well as
  all the stars! display types plus lots more.....
  Some examples:
  * Population
  * Population filling (color changes at 25%/33%)
  * Population growth
  * Resource output
  * Report Age
  * Gate coverage
  * Mining rate
  * Mineral concentration
  * Surface minerals
  * "Global" habitability

The last 4 displays use a method which is more intuitive than the
Stars! histogram, which basically makes a planet look bigger if it's
good, the marker is a pie chart indicating the proportion.  A 100/1/1
mineral concentration world is a fat blue ball, while a 1/50/100 one
is a fat ball 2/3 yellow and 1/3 green. "Global" habitability exploits
this method to put the habitability for ALL races on a single
display. Useful in team games.

- the new version provides a window-based intuitive interface as well
  as the useful "key shortcuts" that you'll learn to use after a
  while....


WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT

- Run smoothly and without problems, even if I have smoothed out
  most of the problems of the last version it is still a hacked thing.
- Play the game for you.


WANNA TRY IT?

You can see some screen shots and read a sample report-log file at:

http://mokulen.univ-lille1.fr/games/stars/starana.html

You can download the AMIUBCSMAS 0.2 package from that page as well.

Note: as indicated in the name it will be incomplete, undocumented and
badly coded. Still, I have included enough documentation to "quickly"
set the program up and use it for your games. You need only to type in
the racial information and some more stuff (filenames of reports,
mostly).  Contrary to the old version, a well-commented example is
provided as a basis for a step-by-step generation of the "master file"
with the racial information.
