Technicalia version 0.2, 29 Jan 1998

[NOTE: I made some fixes, but a part of this information is outdated
and relates to the old 0.1 version.]


FULL DESCRIPTION OF INPUT FILE FORMAT

keywords         typed as shown
data             put between <....> signs
                 I: means number type (maybe not int),
                 S: means string type
optional         put between [.....] can be both keyword or data
alternatives     | sign. 
                 [red|blue] means either 'red' or 'blue'

Almost everything is optional, if you don't place it it should default
to some reasonable value ('reasonable' = the program will not crash
but the result will be wrong).  For planets you don't need to put
everything in the same place, "redefining" a planet with the same name
results in adding information about it. VERY useful, as you can have
the map in one file, the habitability in another and the planet types
in yet another one.

Using stuff BEFORE you define it it's a good way to get massive
screw-ups. If you define a queue with factories BEFORE you specify the
factory cost it will default to 10/?/?/4, which is not what you want.

Ah, in addition to all the stuff here you can do

include some-other-file.smf

to include that file. 'smf' stands for Stars! MetaFile. No ' or "
around the name, just include, some blanks and the name. It's handled
by the lexical analyzer, the parser won't even see it.

You also have:

starsinclude filename.smf starsreport.??

which works exactly like include, but it will auto-convert the
starsreport file to smf format before inclusion. Autoconversion only
works with patch 'i' reports.


Numbers are, numbers: 10, 25, 34.342 etc....
Strings are: a_string "contains a blank" startswithletters123456
             "$%#$!432 anything"

Habitability is given as you read it in Stars! For races there never
are problems since the width gives a method to resolve ambiguities
(it's even). For planets the program will pick something, and tell you
in the report file. You can add a 1 or a 2 as a 3rd gravity digit to
resolve the ambiguity. I usually don't care, but if it makes the
difference between red and green you might want to put it in.

Ok, here is the list.

INNER WORKINGS

All the code works around a few classes. In order of importance they are:

class planet;
class race;
class object;
class queue_obj;

This four are strongly intermixed, as you can see from the multitude
of "friend class xxxx;" which is around. In fact you just have one
real class: planet, all the rest looks more like structs used to keep
data which will be used by planet.

class stars_map;

The container of everything. It holds the planets together and
provides all the mapping/analysis/space ownership functions which the
user sees.

class fleet;

Fleet stuff. Again, this is more like a struct than a real class,
since no evolution is really performed on fleets.

class minerals;

Makes life easier when dealing with minerals. You can add and subtract
all the 3 values in one good-looking line.

class graphics;

Interface to the rest of the world. Check out.h to see what it must
provide to have starana run. It's not much: open window, close, draw
string, draw filled arc, and some other stuff. The problem is that all
the color management is done here, this needs working, as I would like
to specify the race colors in the input files.


SOME RANDOM DESCRIPTIONS

The planet class provides A LOT of methods to access the
data. Everything you might want should be there, and if it isn't it
should be, so I'll add it. Some accessors just return attributes,
other do calculations drawing data also from the race owner
info. Since not too many paranoia checks are performed you should
CHECK THAT A OWNER EXISTS before calling wildly the functions.

All those functions accept an optional parameter, "when", which
indicates at what time to read the data. This is meaningful AFTER the
simulation on the planet has been run, you'll get crap if you try to
get future data before you generate it.
Note: when = 0 is when the data which was read from files. when = -1
is the "current year of the simulation", which is something
not-so-well defined.  ALWAYS SPECIFY a 0 if you want the initial data.


ORDER OF THINGS

The data is read from the files (yyparse).
map.init_ownership() is called to generate the ownership map.
This function calls map.sort_universe(), which does a LOT of stuff:
- it sorts the planets and adjust the coordinate system
- calls map.check_planets_step1():
    - chooses the trusted source
    - guesses type
    - generates habitability tables
- calls map.check_fleets()
    which is badly incomplete and just chooses which fleets
    will be included in the simulation (= those with cargo
    traveling to a known world)
- counts the planets everyone has
- calls map.evolve_planets() to run the full simulation
    - evolves planets on a per-year basis
    - reports the planetary evolutions
- calls map.check_planets_step2()
    - checks the pop/mineral shortages/needs/exports etc
- calls map.empire_report()
    - generates the cute (and sometimes wrong) totals which 
      are at the end of the report-log file
- generates the space partitioning used to speed up the
  space ownership calculation

The report is complete, if "-a" was given on the command line the
program quits, otherwise the graphics is initialized and the initial
map is drawn.

Map drawing is performed by calling map.display_map(), which,
depending on the type of the map requested, calls map.display_space()
to draw the background or map.display_planetinfo() to draw the
planets.

If you want to add more map types you should look in
display_planetinfo() and copy the examples given there.  Adding it to
the "menu" (whahahaha :) is harder, check the array at the beginning
of starana.cc, it contains a list of the map types. You will need to
add an element in the enum _maptype in starana.h and then add a line
in this array to specify: map type as in _maptype, NEXT _maptype to be
used when you hit 'p', map name.  You will also have to change another
line to make it point at your maptype.



MESSAGE FILTERING

Some basic message-handling and message-filtering is possible.
Check the message class and the functions in stuff.cc.


TECH-RELATED STUFF

There's the table of costs in a comment in stuff.cc one day it will go
in, but not now. Right now the tech is ONLY used (together with the TT
lrt) to determine the max terraforming possible for a specified race,
which is used in the tform_left planet function (computes how many
terraform clicks you still have) and the hab_when_max_terraformed
planet function.


QUEUES

Queues are a messy stuff. A planet has a owner (race). A race has a
series of objects. When you add something to a planet queue the table
which is searched is the one associated to the planet owner (BTW this
poses unbelievable problems at file read time, since the program
hasn't yet understood WHO really owns the planet, but it might find a
queue specification....): then a queue_obj is generated an put in the
queue, and it points to the race object as its "prototype".  A queue
can also be associated to a race, in that case it's just copied
verbatim to the planets that the race owns that don't have a queue
specification.
The queues building steps are as follows:

- preliminary check on the queue: activate or delete objects according
to the insert/remove years specified. Clean the autobuild-performed
bits.

- scan the queue:
	- if a "real" object is found then try to build it
	- if an autobuild object is found then check the min/res
          requirements and "convert" it to a "real" object to be built.

There are two separate object creation loops: one check the mineral
limits and the other doesn't. This can turn out useful if you want to
see what are the mineral requirements to build a specified queue
(you'll just see the minerals value go negative).



PLANET TYPES and EXCHANGE MATRIX

In the input files you can manually specify the "planet type" for each
of your worlds.  If you don't the program will guess (and usually pick
the wrong one).
The planetary types are in an enum:

  enum _platype { UNKNOWN=0, LOOTING=1, BREEDER=2, PRODUCTION=3,
		  NEWCOLONY=4, GENERIC=5, MINING=6 };

UNKNOWN is used in the beginning. You can't have this type when the
analysis is performed, so a guessing IS necessary.
The guessing is done in planet.check_data() by calling
planet.guess_type().
LOOTING means a useless planet you just want to loot, very negative
worlds with low pop are assumed to be of this type. They "export"
everything".
BREEDER means a planet you use for breeding pop. Low mineral
concentration and high habitability make a world a "breeder".
Breeder export population and minerals.
PRODUCTION are production centers. They import pop (for res maxxing)
and minerals (unless the have a lot).
NEWCOLONY are newly-created colonies. They might need or export
both pop or minerals.
GENERIC are like NEWCOLONY, but with higher limits. Worlds tend to
be guessed as this type a lot.
MINING are mining worlds. They are NOT guessed, you must specify them
since the are hard to distinguish from PRODUCTION (maybe use mineral
imbalance?)

All this types define the mineral and population needs or "overflow".
The thresholds depend on the planet type and have the bad thing of being
hardwired in planet.min_needs(). I'll turn them to a table like there
is for the population one day. BTW the cute population table doesn't work,
but I never fixed it....

Ok, at the end of the guessing and needs determination we have for
every planet a list which says what it want to import and what to
export. This is used to generate the "xxxxxx sources" tables in the
planetary report, where all "nearby" planets which can offer the
needed stuff are listed. The idea is good, but it still needs A LOT of
fine tuning, as well as fleet max cargo determination to automatically
allocate transporter fleets.
