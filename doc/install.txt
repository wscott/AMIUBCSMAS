WINDOWS INSTALLATION

- you will need to have an "X server" installed to be able to run
starana. I use the demo version of Xwin-32, available at:

http://xwin-32/

It has some requirements, i.e. to have some kind of network support
installed. If you have a network card in your computer then you have
network support and everything will be fine. If you have a modem then
you probably have network support. The documentation and FAQ of
Xwin-32 explains what to do to run the server, check it. (BTW I
suggest download and try, if it doesn't work start reading the
doc.....);

- download the starana binaries and DLLs for win95 and the
documentation/examples;

- unpack it, you'll get a starana-0.2/bin directory with the files:
one exe file, two dll libraries and a README. In order to use the
program you also need default.pfl which is in the documentation
package (it contains the default planet views). You should make a copy
of default.pfl in the directory where you will put the "master file"
for the game (you can do this later).

- check "Running starana" in starana.txt for instructions on how to
  run it (you can't just click on it.....but almost :)



LINUX INSTALLATION / RECOMPILING STARANA

Make sure you have some experience in dealing with C++
compilations/errors/etc.

If you have linux you need to have g++ and X11 development stuff
installed. You also need to have the XForms library installed. You can
fetch it from:

http://xforms/

If you want to recompile on win95 you need to use Cygnus' GNUwin32
package, found at:

http://cygnus/

You also need XForms (see above for link) and X11R6 libraries. I also
used egcs to compile instead of the classic g++. Follow the links from
Cygnus' site to get to the pages where you can download those
packages. Be prepared for a long (20+M) download.

Then:

- get the starana source distribution;

- alter Makefile.local to suit your needs;

Cd to src/ and type make.

You SHOULD have no problem, as I tried both processes and they work.
In any case you can contact me and I'll try to reply as fast as I can.
